            <p>The main idea for this website is to talk about CS:GO (Counter strike: Global Offensive), a game with a lot of history, culture, community, and contribution to the development of the person that I'm today. Therefore I wanted to talk about some historical plays that professional players made, that even Valve (the developer of the game), acknowledged and decided to put in-game references to those moments.</p>

            <p>Each page would have the story of one of those moments while the home page would be a place to give context to the reader about the game and how important those plays were.</p>
