            <h3>Dosia and his Genius Grenade</h3>
            <img width="700" height="400" src="../images/6.webp" alt="">
            <p>Another Inferno moment, another graffiti dedicated to a legendary esports event. PGL Krakow Major 2017 Grand Finals. One single but very clever nade throw was the key to victory on this deciding map.</p>

            <p>Gambit was comfortably leading 9:1. In the eleventh round, Immortals managed to take A and plant the C4 while preserving most of their players. With two remaining players, Gambit chose not to push it and save their weapons.</p>

            <iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzeuySdai40" title="CS:GO - DOSIA 200 IQ HE grenade - Gambit vs Immortals" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p>Trying to make the most out of the situation, Dosia took a risk and tossed a grenade. The decision paid off entirely: Immortals players chose to stay on A and survive the C4 explosion in the far corner. If you have full health, you can easily survive, but the grenade landed exactly where it needed to just seconds before the explosion! Two players lost more than half their health, and the bomb blast finished them! Minus two AK-47s, the economy was disrupted, and a chance for a comeback was lost!</p>

            <p>Valve decided to commemorate this brilliant move with a poster of a grenade-shaped bottle of perfume signed: “You can’t escape”.</p>
